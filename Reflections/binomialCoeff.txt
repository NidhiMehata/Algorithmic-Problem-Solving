Three approaches to compute binomial coeffients(pascal's triangle) are: 
    Iterative using 1d array :
        -Used only when single row of pascal's traingle is needed.In each iteration it replaces the 
         coeffients of previous row with the current row.Hence it is space efficient.
        -Space Complexity : O(k)

    Iterative using 2d array :
        -Used when all the rows of pascal's traingle are needed.
        -Space Complexity : O(n*k)

    Recursive : 
        -Used for a single query and smaller value of n
        -Total number of Recursive calls made are 2^n-1
